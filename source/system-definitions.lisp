;;; O-Plan system definitions

;;; The definitions are in roughly top-down order.

;;; The usual procedure is to (compile-system 'everthing) and then
;;; build an image by starting a fresh Lisp, doing (load-system 'oplan),
;;; and saving a Lisp image.  The "Makefile" in the main source
;;; directory provides a convenient way to do this and other things.

;;; Note (if you're doing things by hand) that the first step is to
;;; load the "oplan.lsp".  It will load this file, among other things.

;;; To print a description of the system structure, evaluate
;;;   (print-system-tree 'everything)

;;; For a description of the defsystem used here, see support/defsys.lsp.

;;; /\/: We need a better, cleaner division into systems.  Even though
;;; they're all called "systems" most of the systems defined in this file
;;; are modules of other sorts; and some of the larger ones should be
;;; broken up along functional lines.  Package use also needs to be cleaned
;;; up.  At present, we have a lot of :do-after-load calls to use-package
;;; that make things visible in the OPLAN package; and some of the code
;;; that's in the OPLAN package should be given a package of its own.
;;; (We're in this mess for historical reasons.  In version 1.2, only
;;; the TF compiler was written as a system; everything else was compiled
;;; and loaded in an ad hoc way, and only the DM was actually compiled.)

;;; /\/: We may want to use a different defsystem, to explicitly
;;; distinguish between systems and modules, to put each system
;;; definition in its own file, etc.

;;; /\/: AKCL complains if packages that were used at compile-time
;;; aren't also used when the .o file is loaded even if no symbols
;;; from those packages were used in the .lsp file.

;;; Support

;;; /\/: May want to separate out the support needed only by -toplevel
;;; files and the like (ipc-support?), so that we don't e.g. recompile
;;; the whole DM every time we change something about p-processes.

;;; The support system contains definitions that can be used throughout
;;; O-Plan.  Higher-level systems typically have support as one of their
;;; :required-systems.  Modifications to support should be relatively
;;; rare, but when they happen the requiring systems will all have to be
;;; recompiled.  (If this becomes a problem, we could separate out the
;;; parts of support that affect compilation or else divide it into smaller
;;; systems; but it would require a fair amount of work.)

;;; The current subsystems of support are base-support, common-support,
;;; dependent-support, and external-support.

;;; Base-support contains portable code needed by both common-support
;;; and dependent-support.  This is the lowest level of "common code"
;;; in O-Plan, and everything outside external-support can assume it
;;; exists.

;;; Most of the support code is in common-support.  This code should work
;;; in at least to all the Common Lisps that will be used with O-Plan.
;;; The files in common-support may contain implementation-dependent code,
;;; but only internally.  (We allow this so that we can use self-contained
;;; packages that handle their own portability and that shouldn't be broken
;;; up just to follow the conventions we use in the body of O-Plan.)

;;; Some especially independent packages, typically code produced outside
;;; the O-Plan project, such as the XP pretty-printer, can be placed in
;;; external-support.  This code does not depend on base-support and is
;;; almost never recompiled.

;;; Most of O-Plan's own code that depends on particular Common Lisp
;;; implementations is confined to dependent-support.  There should be
;;; a version of dependent-support for each Common Lisp that O-Plan
;;; can use.  The conventions for adding new code of this sort are
;;; slightly complex, so we'll describe them here rather than force
;;; you to figure them out.

;;;  * Implementation-dependent code is placed in the UTIL package.
;;;    The package definition itself is portable.  That is, all
;;;    implementations define the same names with the same interface.

;;;  * The UTIL package is defined by the file "util-package" in the system
;;;    base-support (not in dependent-support).  All exports should be
;;;    in that file, but the actual, implementation-specific definitions
;;;    should be in files that are in dependent-support.  Those files
;;;    should all start with (in-package :oplan-util).

;;;  * Whenever possible, only implementation-dependent _functions_ should
;;;    be defined.  For instance, if a macro is needed, the implementation-
;;;    dependent aspects should be placed in functions called in the macro's
;;;    expansion, and definitions of those functions should be placed
;;;    in each version of dependent-support.

;;; This arrangement minimizes the amount of implementation-specific code
;;; and allows common-support to depend only on base-support.

;;; add "util" as a required file each time, and the definitions in
;;; UTIL should seldom require modification.
