;;; This is a much simplified resource manager.  Among the simplifications
;;; are:
;;;
;;;  * Only strictly consumable resources are handled.
;;;  * There is no hierarchy of resource types; all references to
;;;    resources (for both specification and use) must be fully qualified.
;;;  * Resource units and unit synonyms are ignored.
;;;  * Only_use_for_resources is not supported.
;;;  * Resource setting is not allowed; use an overall specification
;;;    in the task schema instead.
;;;
;;; /\/: more...

;;; Some additional simplifications are allowed because the resources
;;; are strictly consumable.  In particular:
;;;
;;;  * The node-end at which consumption occurs is irrelevant.
;;;

;;;; Resource Usage Table

;;; The resource usage table (RUT) is a hash table indexed by a cons
;;; of the form (node-name . fully-qualified-resource-reference), for
;;; example: (node-3-2 . (resource fuel port_1)).

;;; It was necessary decide whether to have different structs in
;;; different contexts or just different slot values for variable
;;; slots.  The latter option was chosen.  Consequently, anything
;;; that wants to treat new-to-context records specially should look
;;; for uninitialized slot values instead of non-existent structs.

  parent	; the parent node's rr for the same resource
  %children	; a list of child node rrs for the same resource
  (%min :undef)	; a non-negative integer
  (%max	:undef)	; a non-negative integer or :inf

;;; Resource-record creation / initialization

;;; Ensure-resource-record creates a record if it does not already

;;; comes along.  When one does, it might be for a node several
;;; levels down, and all of those levels might have to be created.

;;; Ensure-resource-record also ensures that the rr has been initialized.
;;; Intialization fills in the initial min and max use levels for the rr
;;; in a way that is consustent with the levels of the parent and sibling
;;; records.  If consistent values are not possible, then something has
;;; gone wrong earlier (or else we're continuing in an invalid context)
