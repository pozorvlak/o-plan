;;;; Net construction

;;; This can be confusing if you're not already familiar with the TPN.

;;; The :points and :constraints query-args use names to refer to
;;; time-points.  These names are not part of the TPN, and the TPN
;;; routines know nothing about them.  However, the TPN also uses
;;; (generated) point names which, to avoid confusion, are always
;;; called "tags".  The routine that adds a new point to the TPN,
;;; tpn-add-time-point, returns such a tag.  The TPN also generates
;;; tags for constraints.

;;; The code in this file maintains mappings both ways between names
;;; and tags, and the TPN maintains mappings both ways between tags
;;; and point structs.  By using both sets of mappings, we can provide
;;; the procedures name->point and point->name (see below).

;;; Table of points in context

;;; This is similar to a KWIC (Key Words In Context) index.
;;;
;;; It's easiest to explain with an example.  Suppose the constraints
;;; are given by <a,b,[c1,c2,c3],d,[e1,e2],f> with default point range
;;; 0..100 and default constraint range 10..10.  In this table, each
;;; point is shown between its pre and post constraints.  The part of
;;; the table for b looks like this:
;;;
;;;  a= 0.. 50 10.. 10  b=10.. 60 10.. 10 c1=20.. 70
;;;                     b=10.. 60 10.. 10 c2=20.. 70
;;;                     b=10.. 60 10.. 10 c3=20.. 70
;;;
;;; Points are shown as "name=min..max".  "b=10.. 60" shows the
;;; current range for b.  All the "b=10.. 60"s will be in bold,
;;; because in this part of the table it's b that's "in context".
;;;
;;; "a= 0.. 50 10.. 10  b=10.. 60" shows a constraint from a to b.
;;; A's range is 0..50, and the constraint's is 10..10.
;;;
;;; "b=10.. 60 10.. 10 c1=20.. 70" shows a constraint from b to
;;; c1.  C1's range is 20..70, and the constraint's is again 10..10.
;;;
;;; There's no particular relationship between the a -> b constraint
;;; and the b -> c1 constraint.  They're shown on the same line just
;;; to help make the table more compact.
;;;
;;; The aim is to make it fairly easy to see that b's range satisfies
;;; all of the constraints that involve b.  The rest of the table does
;;; the same for the other points.
