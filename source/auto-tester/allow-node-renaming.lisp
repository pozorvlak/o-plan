;;; Call node-renaming-on to cause tpd-equal to allow and report
;;; changes in node names and node-renaming-off to change it back.

;;; (node-renaming-on) happens automatically when this file is loaded.

;;; This version assumes that the renaming leaves nodes so that
;;; equivalent nodes have the same position in the node description;
;;; in effect, equivalence is found by taking nodes in the order in
;;; which they were created (which is the same as the numeric ordering
;;; of their numbers).
