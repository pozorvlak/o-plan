;;; Dependencies on "the rest of O-Plan" are not listed.

;;; Tests aren't normally compiled, so we'll usually be loading
;;; interpreted code.

;;; The test-support system is defined with the main O-Plan system
;;; definitions, because it's often compiled with them.  Tests are
;;; typically not compiled.

;;; Test systems must :require test-support, but they can assume
;;; this gives them the support system as well.
