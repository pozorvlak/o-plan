;;; KS-EXECUTION-FAILURE: effects in the plan fail to occur.
;;; KS-UNEXPECTED-WORLD-EVENT: effects not in the plan occur anyway.

(in-package :oplan-knowledge-source)

;;; Something's happened in the world that was not in the plan.
;;; This is reported as a time, an event pattern, and a list
;;; of effects as (p v) pairs.  For instance, we may get an
;;; event {landslide} with effects
;;;   {status road-a} = blocked
;;;   {status road-b} = blocked
;;;
;;; In Lisp, this is (landslide) and
;;;   (((status road-a) blocked) ((status road-b) blocked))
;;;
;;; [Events are similar to plan actions -- they're just not in the plan.]
;;;
;;; The effects may break GOST ranges in the plan.  If so, we have
;;; to try to satisfy those conditions some other way.  But even if
;;; nothing is broken, we have to add a node to represent the world
;;; event.  Even if the event's effects don't make any difference now,
;;; they may matter later on.
;;;
;;; Note that the new node's effects can't be added until we've
;;; removed any broken GOST entries.  Otherwise the TGM might try
;;; to preserve those entries when we put in the effects.
;;; /\/: Not that we actually use the TGM.
;;;
;;; The new node represents something that has definitely and already
;;; happened.  So it must be linked after all node-ends that have
;;; already been executed and before all node-ends that have not yet
;;; been executed.
;;;
;;; A GOST entry loses a contributor when:
;;;   * the condition is at a node-end that has not been executed,
;;;   * the contributor is a node-end that has been executed, and
;;;   * the unexpected world-event has a conflicting effect.
;;;
;;; A GOST that loses all its contributors is "truly broken", as in
;;; KS-EXECUTION-FAILURE.
;;;
;;; So here's what we do:
;;;
;;;   /\/: Should we push a context before changing the plan state?
;;;
;;;   Add an event node, E, to represent the world event.  Link it
;;;   after all node-ends that have been executed and before all node-ends
;;;   that haven't.  Mark E as having already been executed.
;;;
;;;   Edit the GOST to remove any contributors that can no longer
;;;   contribute, and get a list of the truly broken GOST entries.
;;;
;;;   For each truly broken GOST entry g:
;;;     Set up for and post a :FIX agenda entry as in KS-EXECUTION-FAILURE,
;;;     using end_of E as the after-point.
;;;
;;;   Add the world event's effects at end_of E.  This should be easy,
;;;   because we've removed or modified all conflicting GOST entries,
;;;   because of the way E's linked, and because all PSVs are bound.
;;;
;;;   If there were no truly broken GOST entries, we're done.
;;;
;;;   Otherwise, push the current list of alternatives, so we don't
;;;   backtrack into them while dealing with the :FIX agenda-entries,
;;;   and post a :CONTINUE-EXECUTION to continue execution after the
;;;   fixes have been made. 
;;;
;;; /\/: There are some complications that don't occur with an EXECUTION-
;;; FAILURE.  It's not completely clear what to do about them.  When there's
;;; a failure at some node-end, some effects may not occur.  But nothing
;;; that depended on those effects will be sent off for execution until
;;; the plan's been fixed, because nothing's sent until all "contributors"
;;; have completed execution.  (What we have here is a failure as a
;;; completion.  So anything that needed the effects will still be waiting.)
;;; Maybe _other_ things might execute, but that should be ok.
;;;
;;; But with an UNEXPECTED-WORLD-EVENT, some things may execute (ie, be
;;; sent to the World for execution) when they shouldn't.  (Maybe the
;;; Exec starts something happening in the World and an unexpected
;;; event happens before the World receives that message.  Even greater
;;; timing problems occur when the Planner's brought in.)  We might try
;;; to handle this by giving the World a more elaborate model, so that
;;; plan steps effected by the unexpected event would fail, but then we
;;; might get a bunch of failures.  Getting everything right in such
;;; cases may be tricky.
;;;
;;; We therefore assume that things don't happen so quickly that there
;;; are timing problems.  However, there's still the case where several
;;; things are supposed to happen at the same time.  What if an unexpected
;;; event happens in the middle of them?
