;;;; Simulated time

;;; [This section describes "scaled real time".  An alternative is
;;; "purely simulated time", which will be described below if it's
;;; ever implemented.]

;;; World time in the simulated world, henceforth known "simulated
;;; time", is in seconds and is related to real time seconds by a
;;; scale factor that indicates how many seconds of simulated time
;;; pass for each second of real time.  The scale factor should be
;;; an integer >= 1.  This is not essential, but to properly support
;;; scale factors < 1, we should switch to a floating point
;;; representation of simulated time.

;;; Our actual real-time clock is O-Plan's primitive-real-time, which
;;; normally ticks in a unit smaller than seconds.  This complicates
;;; the handling of simulated time somewhat but usually lets us avoid
;;; using universal times, which tend to be bignums.

;;; /\/: Unfortunately, primitive-real-time is usually internal-real-time
;;; which is even bigger bignums in Common Lisps such as Lucid 4.1.

;;; The conversion is initialized relative to a given universal time
;;; rather than to the time when start-clock is called.  This allows
;;; one agent (usually the Exec) to establish the relationship between
;;; real and simulated time and tell another agent (such as the World)
;;; what it is, rather than have the 2nd agent's version of simulated
;;; time be slow relative to the 1st's because of the time that elapsed
;;; before it was able to process the request.  So if the Exec wants
;;; to say "it's now simulated time t -- start your clock", it has to
;;; say when "now" is, for otherwise the Exec's now (when it sends the
;;; :start-clock message) and the World's now (when it receives the
;;; message) will be different.

;;; The conversion from universal time to primitive real time, used
;;; when initializing simulated time, is provided by the p-process
;;; mechanism (in the single-process version of O-Plan).

;;; N.B. If you use a scale-factor that is large for the frequency
;;; of events (e.g. 1 second = 1 day with things happening every
;;; few minutes), it may be difficult for simulated time to keep
;;; up.

;;; Each pprocess that wants a clock must provide a binding for *clock*.
;;; If more than one pprocess may have a clock, *clock* should be one of
;;; pprocess-sepecials of each pprocess that might have one.  A pprocess
;;; calls define-a-clock to give *clock* a value.

;;; However, code that uses clocks should not refer to *clock* directly
;;; (except when creating the binding).

;;;   real-delta = (floor primitive-delta primitive-time-units-per-second)
;;;   sim-delta = (* real-delta simulated-seconds-per-second)
